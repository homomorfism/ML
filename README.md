AI pipeline:

- find a large classification dataset to train on
- check https://paperswithcode.com/ for a top CNN for this model
- implement this model or take a code from GitHub
- apply augmentations
- train the model and analyze the results


Plan for the first week:
- 9.06.2020 - training simple CNN on CIFAR100, reading the documentation for torchvision
- 10.06.2020 - training model from torchvision.models for some dataset
- 11.06.2020 - fitting parameters for this model/trying different models/augmentations



Plan for the second week:
- learn metrics for models and try different implementations

- 15.06.2020 - comparing different models and their metrics after training on different datasets
- 16.06.2020 - learning Git and working with remote server

- 17.06.2020 - 19.06.2020 - writing code that evaluate the performance of models, trained and tested on different datasets and fixing bugs


Plan for the third week:
- learn how to apply transfer learning

Plan for the fourth week:
- optimization my CNN for detecting different datasets
